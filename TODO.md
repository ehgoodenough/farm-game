### To Do Next ###
- Add some UI to see your resources: wood and gold.
- Add a separate screen in the mount, a shop screen. Be able to toggle between the game screen and shop screen.
- Add the ability to sell the wood for gold.
- Change the saplings in your inventory to be a finite supply.
- Be able to buy more saplings with gold from the shop.

Eventually:
- Title Screen
- Saving progress between page refreshes.
- [Juice] Soft sway of the wind in the trees.
- [Scope creep] More kinds of trees!
- [Usability] Make the space above an empty plot also clickable/hoverable.
- [Juice] Add a sound when the tree is getting cut, watered, etc.
- [Juice] Cutting trees should take a few clicks, not just one click.
- [Usability] Unselecting the currently selected item.
- [Juice] Use icons (not text) for the inventory.
- Day/Night Cycle, Growing

To Explain Better:
- More jsdoc!
- Make a list of files for touring the codebase.
